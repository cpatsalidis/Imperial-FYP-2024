# This repository gathers all the tools required to obtain the results outlined in the `Learning and Deliberation for
Requisite Social Influence', which details my work on the Undergraduate Final Year Project. The project was built upon 
the preexisting notions and code presented in the `Requisite Social Influence in Self-Regulated Systemsâ€™ by Mrs. Mertzani.
